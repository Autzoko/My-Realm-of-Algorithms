# My Realm of Algorithms

This repository is mainly for myself to learn baisc and advanced algorithms. It is devided into two parts:

- note: where I write notes according to the codes, and comments.
- src: source files.
- obj: executive files.

All these files are fetched accordingly.

*Thank to the book published by THU Press and the help from my friend (a master of algorithms)*
